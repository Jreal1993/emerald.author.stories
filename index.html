        <h3>May 1st, 2022</h3>
        <p>I decided I want to leave something behind in case the inevitable happens. I know that I am looking at potentially limited time left and I may need to abandon this journal in a hurry but for now I want to write my story. The world is turned upside down right now, and I don’t know how long I will be safe here. I have my bags packed and I am following the instructions that were left for me. I suppose I should do an introduction of sorts, my name is Nyx. I was just an average girl before the change. I am an author, and a bit of a recluse.. I am somewhat survivalist in the off season, I live in my cabin alone in the beautiful cascade mountains. I love being out in the wild. I hunt for most of my food and collect my water from the stream nearby. I have no family... At least I am not going to cause anyone pain if I do not survive this. I think this is a good stopping point for tonight, I need to check the perimeter and get underground soon.  
            </p>
            <h3>May 2nd, 2022</h3>
         <p>So I was thinking all last night what I should write about and I think I should just start from the beginning. I woke up about two months ago in March. I had gone to sleep feeling a little worn out and when I woke up I was encased inside of this crusty casing. My whole body was covered! I had to rip it open to escape, tearing and clawing at the scab-like material surrounding me. I finally was able to break out, but when I tried to stand up my legs turned to jelly causing me to crash into the floor. My stomach was in so much pain I could hardly breathe. It felt as though someone had reached their hands inside my body and was wrenching on my intestines. I dragged my useless body across the cold floor to the fridge only to be met with a putrid wave of rotten food inside. Everything was molding and dissolved into goo. I was crying in frustration when I remembered the tuna! I crawled over to the pantry and there it was, the most beautiful thing in the world. A stack of canned tuna. I ripped the top off the cans shoveling the fish into my mouth not even caring how messy I was being. I ate all twelve cans in seconds. Once I had finished all the tuna the thirst hit me, the dry cracked skin all over my body and my bleeding split lips begged to be hydrated. I climbed onto the sink and just stuck my head under the running water. I gulped down all the water I could get into my body. Until the worst thing possible happened, my body started rejecting the food and water I just had, purging it from my system. I collapsed back onto the floor vomiting everything back out until I passed out from the pain.
When I woke back up again there was a man there. He told me he was named Falcon. 
He said he was with a group of survivors called Eden. Falcon was very kind as he explained he had 
been searching for people who had been marked as missing. He told me he found my cabin 
listed as properties I owned and checked here before my cabin in Alaska. He said I was 
lucky he found me first before the government had. He altered my documents online so it 
showed this cabin belonged to someone else now. I was confused at first as I didn't understand who would report me missing and why would the government be looking for me? I had done nothing 
wrong, just gotten sick somehow. Falcon explained to me that all the people who had taken the 
vaccine had died except about .5%. Out of those about ½ of them died in the first month or two 
after awakening. Falcon told me it was unusual that I had taken six months to wake up as most
 people emerged from the chrysalis after only a month. The survivors had been taken away to special hospitals and their families were informed they had passed away. 
The truth is they were taken away to a hidden location.

<p>Well, except for those lucky unlucky people like myself who did not have 
  someone to call 911 for them when they collapsed or didn't wake up. He told me there is a list 
  of people in “missing” status where they have no idea what has happened to them. He has dozens 
  of them that he has saved, they are at their camp. Naturally I was very skeptical but it was hard 
  to deny the evidence. I had pieces of the cocoon still flaking off of my skin, and my once short
   blonde hair had become hip length. He told me to use his phone and check online to see if 
   I didn't believe him. So I checked the most reliable source of information, social media. 
   I saw nothing but pages of “RIP” and “Forever in our hearts.” I couldn’t believe this wasn’t 
   all some messed up dream but the proof was there. I decided I am going to join them when I am 
   strong enough. He said I should be safe here for a few months. I was too weak to travel and 
   so he promised to come back to me in a couple months. The location of my cabin is secluded and 
   therefore difficult to get in and out of as there is no road but it needs to be hiked into.
   He had told me one more thing before he left, that people had been developing strange powers 
   shortly after and that because of that the people from the government were also looking for me. 
   Falcon told me he had given himself a new name after awakening to better fit his power. When I asked him what it was he told me he could change into a peregrine falcon which is how he was able to get here without being seen. He Gave me a list of precautions to take and how to hide. The rules I now needed to live by were simple. <br><br>
<br><br>1.     No use of the internet or phone.
<br><br>2.     No contacting other people.
<br><br>3.     Secure the fence line of the property and deadbolt the gate closed. 
<br><br>4.     Sleep and stay in the basement at night, no lights on in the main cabin that could be seen in the dark.
<br><br>5.     Wait for him to return, have a go bag ready that has supplies for three days walking. 
         </p><p>        After he had given me my new rules I followed him outside and watched as he morphed into a small bird. He was gorgeous, with a coal colored head that faded into a slate gray colored back and wings. He took off into the sky leaving me to prepare for him to return with backup. I got to work clearing the edging of the fence line as best I could, my body still weak from the transformation but was gaining strength fast. I also made sure my four wheeler was gassed up and hidden outside the fence in case I needed to make a quick break for it. I resigned myself to only allowing small bits of food and sips of water for the following week to not overwhelm my body. I luckily had a store of non-perishable food in the basement as I usually stay here for the off seasons. I moved my bed and tv down into the basement to stay out of the main area during the night. Anyway, this is a good enough end to my journaling for today. </p>
 
<h3>May 3rd, 2022</h3>
            <p>So last night when I was checking the fence line I noticed a small hole had been dug out near the garden and some of my vegetables had been ripped out. I think a rabbit has found its way in. I filled the hole back in but then this morning it was dug back out again. I set a little trap to see if I can catch the little critter tonight. It has been almost two months since Falcon left me, and he should be coming back soon. I hope. It has been so lonely. Maybe I can make a little pet out of this rabbit. Anyways, back to the story at hand. About a week after Falcon left I started having weird headaches and I worried that this would be the end. I had to lay down more frequently but then something happened. In the morning I was woken up with a terrible pain all over my body like I was being cooked from the inside out. The burning heat felt as though it was trying to burst out of me. I realized quickly that I was floating in the air alone with all the objects in the room. Then suddenly I just fell, like someone dropping a rock out of their hand onto the floor. I could feel the heat still but it was more like I was cozied up next to a fire rather than being lit on fire. I noticed that when I was reaching for cans to put them back sometimes if I stretched my hand out too fast the object would get propelled away from me. Wondering if this could be my power I started practicing. I would focus really hard on something and could sometimes get it to drag across the floor to my hand. I started practicing about eight to ten hours a day. Not like I had anything else going on. This brings us up to the present. I am not able to control things just by looking at them. It is amazing! I can look at a can of coke and it will  come to me and it will float through the air into my hand. I never imagined this could be my life. I am working on attempting to make myself levitate again like what happened that first night. I think eventually I will be able to fly! I have started by telling my shoes to go up but I can only go about an inch off of the ground currently. 
            Good night for now.</p>
<h3>May 4th, 2022</h3>
            <p>Great news this morning! I caught the rabbit. I decided to name him Rodger. He is actually pretty chill. I have never had a pet before, so I am pretty excited. He just seems too much on the grass in the yard so it shouldn't be a problem to keep him fed. He stays pretty close to my side as we walk the fence line and I have been tossing him little bits of corn nubs to keep him interested in staying with me instead of him wandering away.  I finally have someone to tell all my troubles to. He is a small white rabbit with long ears and a pink little nose. I am not really sure what kind he is as I have no access to look it up right now. I told him all about how Falcon would be coming back soon to get us, and I plan to bring him with me. Rodger is my only family in the world now. I have been keeping an eye out in the sky for any signs of Falcon as it has been two months and he should hopefully be here any day. I have a backpack packed up with some dry food, a change of clothes, a small first aid kit, flashlight and water filtration tablets. 
            </p>
<h3>May 10, 2022</h3>
            <p>So, super weird this morning I could have sworn I had put my bag next to the front door, but it was on the couch when I got up. I must be losing my mind cooped up in this cabin all alone. I was telling Rodger this morning how we need to be ready to go when Falcon gets here. Surprisingly he is a really good listener. He just sat there looking at me. Not that he can actually understand me, but it keeps me sane to talk to something living. I was showing him how I can use my powers to have things levitate over to me and he seemed interested, well for a rabbit. He is always following me around as I walk around the yard and inside the house. Well, that’s all for today. Still waiting. </p>
<h3>May 15,2022</h3>
            <p>So, it has been a few days, I lost my journal. I keep losing things. I am not sure what is going on. I feel like I am going crazy. There are weird things happening. I know this sounds crazy, but I felt like I heard someone talking last night but when I creeped up to the main floor there was no one there. I am thinking there is something off with Roger. I don’t know if that doesn’t make any sense. He is a little rabbit, he eats grass in the yard and poops as he walks. </p>
    <h3>May 16, 2022</h3>
            <p>I think Roger is like Falcon, I heard voices AGAIN. I heard someone talking again in the middle of the night, so I was very quiet as I made my way closer to the hatch of the basement. I could hear the person almost like giving an update. Here’s what I remember. 
            “I have found out that the rebels will be arriving soon to collect the girl. She is planning on taking me with her so we can finally get a location for their base. In case they won’t let her bring me I want you to remain close by and follow from afar. It could be any day so get into position. I am still undetected so far but she seems to be more standoffish lately so this will be my last communication.”
            I couldn’t believe my ears! Rodger definitely was the same as Falcon. I am doing this final update and will be making a run for it in a few hours after I see him go to sleep in his crate. I hope I can put in my next update that I made my daring escape and got away unscathed, but if I don’t make it, hopefully someone will find this journal and know I tried. -Nyx.

    <div class="linksJourney" id="linksJourney">
        <h1>Link's Journey</h1>
        <p>Why is it so hard for the rebels to understand? If they came to the island, they could be treated and released once they either find a cure or prove they are not a threat. We are not the bad guys! I was saved by the institute, they treated me after my awakening and helped me through finding out what my powers were. They put me through the trials on the island and I can now shift in and out of my alternate form at will. I no longer need to be afraid of my powers and what could happen if I lose control of them. I can’t imagine being stuck as a hare for the rest of my life!
        </p>
        <p>“Captain Link we are getting close to shore, should we brief the crew now?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Jace gather the men and meet me in the galley in 15.” </p>
        <p>It’s my first mission, first time leaving the island since I transformed into the beast I am now, and I don’t want to disappoint my superiors. They believed in me, put their trust in me. I won’t disappoint them!</p>
        <p>“Alright men, listen up, we got word of rebels hiding out near the Seattle area. I am thinking they could be using the cascades as a home base and going into the major cities to restock and have access to the major ports. I want to break into three groups one to search around the ports and see if there is any activity going in and out of here. The next group will be going into the city and seeing if they can infiltrate any groups that may know where the rebels are hiding. The final group will be Jace and I; we will be going into the cascade mountains. We are the only ones who can transform into animals so we will be able to go through the mountains fast and unnoticed. Does anyone have any questions?”
        </p>
        <p>“No sir!”</p>
        <p>“Good, grab your teams and head out. If you make contact otherwise meet back at the boat in six months, good luck men!”</p>
        <p>This mission needs to go well, I can’t afford to come back empty handed. They will never trust me if I can’t complete my first mission. I am so thankful I have Jace and that he made it through the awakening with me. We have been best friends our whole life, we got into the paramedic program together, got vaccinated together, and transformed together. We both even have shape-shifting abilities, albeit different animals. I am a Hare while he is a hawk. It works out for us well as a team, we can cover the ground and the air. </p>
        <p>
            “Hey Link, should we start at the base of Mt Reiner? Or go someplace else?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yeah, let’s start there. I doubt we will really find anyone out here, but we need to make sure. I asked Sasha for an updated list of everyone who is on the missing list that owns land or has family members who own land in this area. I saved one before we left but sometimes people get crossed off. I’ll go and check all the listings from the ground. I want you to search higher up the mountain and see if there are signs of rebels in the area from above. Report back if you see anything and we will go in closer together.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Copy that, BOSS.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ha, you should be the boss, not me. Just be safe out there.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I have the skies don’t worry about me. You be safe and don’t get eaten by some coyote or something.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Bing! Bing! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hmm, seems a bit too early for a text from Jace. Oh! Its Sasha with updated list details. This is weird, the list is shorter than the old one I saved before leaving. Seems this Nyx girl suddenly dropped off the list of property owners in this area. Seems a bit strange due to her lack of family. I should still check it out. Looks like I know where I am going first. The cabin is pretty close to here. I should arrive just after dark.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fence around the cabin in taller than I would have expected but it should be easy enough to dig under. The cabin itself was modest in size, and pretty standard as far as cabins go. A cherry wood stain was on the actual cabin and the door was one of those where there was a large oval stain glass window in the middle of it. There were lots of plants all over the property which makes It easy for me to hide. There are no lights on that I can see, but the outside are looks well-kept and the fence is locked up from the inside with a deadbolt. It seems likely someone could be living here. Looking in the windows I can’t see anyone inside. I need to go find a spot to hide and wait to see if someone comes outside. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There she is! Nyx looks like someone who had undergone the awakening. She had light blonde hair, almost white all the way to her butt. She was so skinny she looked like she could be a walking skeleton. People when they first wake up often have long grown out hair, that lightens due to the lack of light, and they often come much smaller than they go in. She appears to be walking the fence like. I have a chance to get inside and scope the place out before she gets to back around to the door. Once inside I could see she had all her electronics in a small box, labeled “DO NOT TOUCH!” She is being awfully smart for a tour guide. It looks like she has been journaling her life. Perfect! She has made contact with the rebels. I wish I had this Falcon’s real name. It’s interesting to see another animal shapeshifter, I thought me and Jace were unique. It looks like she is planning to join the rebels. This couldn’t be more perfect. I just have to wait here for them to come and follow them back to their base. Once night falls, I can sneak back out to my supplies. I had the team make me a small bag to carry a phone on my back in hare form. I had hidden it in a tree trunk before coming under the fence. Of course, she had filled my hole in, like that really makes a difference. She seems to want to trap me from the looks of it, she has left a little bunny cage trap nearby. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Jace, get to my location now!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Bzz. Bzz.  
        </p>
        <p>
            “Copy.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Listening to her talk to herself I know she plans to keep me as a pet if she can catch me, it could be beneficial to let her. I think I will. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Gotcha little bunny! You are going to live with me now. How does the name Rodger sound?”
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="falcon" id="falcon">
        <h1>Falcon's Journey</h1>
        <p>
            The government was taking people as quickly as they could find them, they knew there was a limited amount of time to get them out of the cities and into hiding. There are still too many unaccounted for, our spy inside the institute has told us of a potential new awakened that is out in the cascade mountains. She has been unaccounted for and she should be dead now, but they seem to think she has awakened. We need to get to her cabin first to get her out. Someone who has been in the cocoon for over 6 months should be very ill when she wakes up, and she should have an interesting power.  “Hey, do you have the stuff ready? I need to get going before it gets dark.” Falcon yelled to his group. “It’s already on the perch, check before you ask.” Yelled back Sasha. Falcon turns to face the small bird perch, with the little bag sitting on it. He takes off into a sprint, stretching his arms out and flapping them until they turn into wings, and he shrinks down into a small falcon. “Thanks” Fallon bellows as he snatches the bag off the perch and flys away. “Radio check” Falcon says. “Copy check” replies Sasha. “I am going to check site 1 first, if she is there we can work out an extraction plan” Falcon said. “Copy” replied Sasha.
        </p>
        <p>
             Falcon flew for hours, until he came upon a small cabin in the woods, nestled on the bottom of a cliff next to a little stream. It looked like the ideal little hideaway. As Falcon landed on the banister he could see an emaciated woman laying on the floor covered in vomit. She was surrounded by open tuna cans. Rookie mistake. Most people don’t realise you can’t eat much after not eating for long periods of time. Falcon did a quick check of the cabin before coming inside and picking her up and putting her on the couch. He wiped the vomit off of her face, he could see the bones sticking out of her face, and her eyes were sunken in. She wouldn’t be in condition to move for quite awhile. She may not even survive, there is no cure for the sickness once it takes the awakened. “Hello? Who are you?” whispered Nyx. “Hello Nyx, I am Falcon, I know this may seem sudden but there have been complications with the vaccine.” answered Falcon “Oh..” responded Nyx. Falcon lightly tapped Nyx on the face, he needed to let her know what was happening before he leaves. “Nyx, I need you to pay attention as we may not have much time. All the people who have taken the vaccine had died except about .5%. Out of those about ½ of them died in the first month or two after awakening. It’s unusual that you have taken six months to wake up as most people emerged from the chrysalis after only a few days. The survivors had been taken away to special hospitals and their families were informed they had passed away. The truth is they were taken away to a hidden location. Well, except for those lucky- unlucky people like yourself who did not have someone to call 911 for them when they collapsed or didn't wake up. There is a list of people in “missing” status where they have no idea what has happened to them. We have dozens of them that we have saved, they are at camp. There is more to explain, but not time to do it.” said Falcon “What are you talking about? How do I know I can believe you? What do you mean awakened?” asked Nyx. “Awakened are what we have been calling people like you and I, we have woken from the cocoon and emerged different. Everyone who survived the transformation has gained some type of ability. I can transform into a Falcon, that is why I now go by the name Falcon. Many of us changed our names after the transformation.” said Falcon. “You are crazy, this is all crazy.” said Nyx. “You just have to trust me.I have to let the team know I found you and we will work on coming to get you, for now you are too ill to move. I will be back in a month at the most, it’s important you do not try to leave on your own. It is important you do not use the internet, or contact anyone. Keep your phone off and do not use the lights during the night. I have changed the paperwork that says you own this cabin to a different person, hopefully that will keep them away. You need to be ready to go when we get here, have a bag packed and ready and make sure you secure and lock the main gate so no one can come in easily.” Warned Falcon.
        </p>

    <div class="lostGirl" id="lostGirl">
        <h1>The Lost Girl</h1>
        <p>
            The waiting room was cold, as the girl sat ankles crossed next to her sleeping mother. She wondered if she tried to run, how far could she make it on her own? Would anyone even care if she left? Would they prefer it?
        </p>
        <p>
            “Let’s go.” Hollered the nurse from the doorway.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Okay, I’m coming.” Mumbled the girl. She didn’t want to wake her mother, who was exhausted from working the night before to make up for missing work. She had booked the plane tickets to get her to the clinic in Seattle. The girl was pregnant, and her parents told her she needed to get rid of the baby. She had wanted to keep it but decided to listen to her parents for once in her life.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Take these.” Demanded the nurse.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the girl swallowed down the handful of pills the nurse rattled off their purpose only to end by telling her they would trigger a miscarriage if she didn’t follow through with the abortion. The reality set in for the girl as she took the final gulp of water washing down her pills. The girl was sent back out to the waiting room. Desperate for air she bolted for the parking lot only to vomit up all the medication and her breakfast all over the parking lot. Slowly she went back inside and took her place next to her mother. She gets called back again, same mean nurse.

        </p>
        <p>
            “Lay on the table, we need to take an ultrasound of the baby to see how far along you are.”

        </p>
        <p>
            “Womp womp…womp womp…womp womp…”
        </p>
        <p>
            “There is your baby.” Said the nurse as she handed the girl her ultrasound picture and left. She just stared at the photo; the small little bean shaped almost human she had sentenced to death. The taste of salt hit her mouth before she realized she was crying. The shakes were worse as she slid from the small table onto the floor. All alone on the floor she cried for the first time, not even sure why. Was she mourning the loss of her baby? Of her youth? Her innocence? Who knows? She dragged herself up onto the table not wanting to show her fear and weaknesses to the lady who clearly had an issue with her. Two new women came in, they turned the lights low and had the girl lay back. The pain was intense. Probably due to the vomiting of the pain pills previous to this. One lady massaged a hot pad onto the girl’s belly as the other completed the procedure. Twisting and pulling her insides. The lady up top was trying to help the girl, she was coaching her breathing, holding her hand and massaging with the other hand. The nurse helped the girl get up and set her up with birth control then sent her back out to her sleeping mother. She was no longer pregnant, and the loneliness she felt was like a blackhole was forming inside of her where her baby had once been. It was finally time to go home.

            A blinding white light encompassed her entire field of vision, no matter what direction she looked it seemingly followed her not allowing her to escape it. Cass attempted to slow her breathing letting her eyelids close and counting to ten. Her eyelids felt as though they were glued down as she forced herself to open them once more, letting the sparkles of black and white slowly reveal a vast field before her. She feels the warmth of the sun beating down on her as she sprawled out in the field. The waves of green grass were brushing against her skin like a thousand fingers tickling her all at once. The crisp breeze brought the familiar scent of the cedar trees that bordered the edges of the clearing like soldiers guarding her. The wind also brought the muffled cries of someone calling out her name, beckoning her home. Cass propped herself up, balanced on her elbows she could see the figure who was calling out to her, a shadow in the distance. She wanted to follow, to spring up and dash towards her mystery caller, but she could not make herself move. She felt as though she is tied down by weights keeping her in place. Cass could feel her sorrow washing over herself as the figure disappeared into the woods, she could taste the salt of her tears as they ran down her face uncontrollably. Cass could not understand why she felt this way; she was not even sure who the shadowy figure was, but it left her feeling as though a piece of her was vanishing along with them into the unknown. Slumping back down into the grass she allowed herself to drift back off into a slumber. Cass bolted upright drenched in hot sweat, her clothing sticking to her body as she slid her legs to the side of the bed. She had been having this dream every night since she arrived on the island. It always ended the same and she always awoke, caked in sweat and tears.

            Theo found peace in the mornings he spent out on the ocean. He used this time to prepare for the long days he had at work. The time he spends caring for his patients in the emergency room was hectic and sometimes they couldn't be saved. He wondered if being a surgeon was really worth it? If the pain of watching people cycle in and out of his operating room, some people never leaving that table alive. He felt the pain of every loss, they weighed heavy on his heart. These mornings spent on the ocean have been cathartic for him, allowing him to release some of those pent up feelings. He has been carrying the stress around for far too long.

            A buzzing sound in the distance yanks him from his daze. Dropping him right back into reality, there was a speed boat coming his way, fast. Theo attempted to get his kayak steered out of the way, to angle it to take the wave, but he was too slow. He was in the water before he knew what hit him. The immediate pain of the icy cold water was overwhelming. Theo could not move his arms properly, the numbness had set in almost immediately.

            Why had I not worn my life jacket?

        </p>
        <p>
            Where is my kayak?
        </p>
        <p>
            Why is the surface getting so far away?
        </p>
        <p>
            I can’t die today, there are people waiting for me to help them. If I die, who will make sure they have someone there to greet them when they wake up, or to tell their families when they don't?

            The thoughts were racing in his mind trying to find a way to survive. The searing pain coming up from deep inside his chest was now working its way into his throat. It was unbearable. He gasped for air, only to take in gulps of the sea, like he was attempting to drink the whole ocean. The faces of those he could not save flashed before his eyes. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Is this how they felt?
        </p>
        <p>
            Did they die scared? 

        </p>
        <p>
            Were they pleading for life as they faded away? No, they died with someone holding their hand, someone who had wept over them in their final moments. 

        </p>
        <p>
            I would die alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The darkness crept in from all sides now, taking away the little light there was left. The frantic searching only left his body aching as he struggled against the grip of the ocean pulling him down. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Where is my kayak?

        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, there it is. Everything will be okay now….
        </p>
        <p>
            The little kayak sitting in the last dot of light reminded him to let go of his worries one last time.
